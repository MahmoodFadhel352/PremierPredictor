# ‚öΩ PremierPredictor

PremierPredictor is a web application that allows users to **predict football match results** and track their performance over time. It is designed to bring fans closer to the game with fun, interactive predictions where users can see predictions from other users.

## üìù About the App
PremierPredictor is a full-stack **Django web application** for football (soccer) fans who want to predict outcomes of **English Premier League** matches.  

- Users can **sign up, log in, and manage predictions** for upcoming fixtures.  
- Each match includes home/away teams, kickoff date/time, and results (once available).  
- Predictions track a user‚Äôs pick (home/draw/away) and optional probability inputs.  
- Teams and matches are shared publicly, but only their creator can edit or delete them.  
- Protects data integrity: Teams with scheduled matches cannot be deleted until dependent matches are resolved.  

The app was built to combine my passion for the Premier League with my experience in **full-stack software engineering**. It demonstrates clean CRUD, media uploads, form validation, and user access control.
